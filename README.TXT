You can create a list on your editor and then in the side panel in advanced, anchor set it to "bvideo_playlist".

Also you can edit the HTML and create List with id = bvideo_playlist:

<ol id="bvideo_playlist">
    <li><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/HD_downloads/earth_night_rotate_1080.mov">Animation: Rotating Earth at Night</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/HD_downloads/rbsp_launch_1080p.mp4">Radiation Belt Storm Probes Launch</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/HD_downloads/curiosity_lands.mov">Dropping in on Mars in High-Res</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/HD_downloads/HLV_Launch_anim.mov">Space Launch System Animation</a></li>
</ol>


You can also add in your HTML/JS file a playlist array and will create your list magically, the size field itâ€™s optional:

<script>
var video_playlist = [
    {
        "name": "Animation: Rotating Earth at Night",
        "link": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/HD_downloads/earth_night_rotate_1080.mov",
        "size": 55000000,
    },
    {
        "name": "Radiation Belt Storm Probes Launch",
        "link": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/HD_downloads/rbsp_launch_1080p.mp4",
        "size": 475000000,
